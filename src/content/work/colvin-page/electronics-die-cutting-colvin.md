# Best Electrical Component Die Cutting Services

Since Colvin-Friedman was founded right after World War II, we have invested our time and labor into producing components for the nascent high-tech world. Today, we have more than 75 years of experience in die-cutting for the electronics industry and we’re proud to have been a part of the first TVs up to the cutting edge of technology in the 21st century.

However, while die cutting may be used for high-speed runs for different materials used in electronics manufacturing, that speed can never be at the expense of accuracy and precision. Below are some of the most common materials that we die-cut for our electronics manufacturing clients.

## Best Practices for Electronics Die Cutting

With such disparate material types, it may seem difficult to imagine that one die cutter has the experience to work with each, given different characteristics like tensile strength, flexibility, resistance to heat, and even conductivity. However, we have developed a set of best practices for each material type.
