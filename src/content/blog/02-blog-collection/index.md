When looking into how much you will need to invest to go green with your own electrical generation system, it is important to know where the different elements of a bid on the project will come from. So, when it comes to knowing how much does it cost to install solar panels in San Diego, one needs to break it down into inspection costs, material and component pricing, optional additions and labor.

# Initial Consultation, Inspection and Permitting
No legitimate company will charge you for coming out to your home and providing an estimate on a solar panel installation. That part is free, and will give you a good idea of:

1)	What size installation you need to maximize your savings - all systems cost a few thousand dollars at least, but the larger the system, the more energy you need to be recovering to offset the cost
2)	How the system will work with your home - While both rooftop and separate installations are possible, the solar consultant will likely also try to plan a system that maximizes collection and this can depend on the slope of your roof, neighborhood and other factors.
3)	The cost of add-on features - Batteries and power walls allow homeowners to store energy during cloudy and stormy periods, maximizing the value of their investment.

In addition to this, a consultant with a solar installation company will also help you understand what permitting and other government fees will be necessary, as well as any potential issues with the municipal code and/or your homeowners association.

# Panel and Bracket Cost
The majority of the cost to install solar panels in San Diego is the cost of the individual photovoltaic panels themselves. There are several different brands, including LG Solar, Panasonic and many others. Similar to other home equipment, a qualified installer will usually have a relationship with manufacturers that they trust because of reliability and quality. Each manufacturer differs in pricing, but paying a dollar or so per watt for the panels themselves would not be out of line with the current market in 2022.

Another additional cost is based on the mounting system that is used. Depending on the material of your roof, your solar installer may be able to use brackets that clamp onto seams in your roof, or they may use a rail system that allows them to mount the panels to the roof somewhat independently of its design. There are other methods, as well, but all are based on maximizing the availability of the panels to collect sunlight and maintain the integrity of the roof.

# Cost of Labor
Solar panels can be fragile if handled improperly, and rooftop work requires special care by installers. Trained and insured professionals must handle solar installations to minimize the risk of injury or damage, not just to the investment of a solar system but also to the roof itself. Any small leak in a roof can damage not just the material itself, but soak the insulation, rendering it completely useless.

As a result, homeowners in San Diego should expect a reasonable amount of labor to be built into any solar system installation quote. Additional hours for things like batteries, power walls, or specialized mounting systems are a normal part of the process.

# Batteries and Powerwalls
Solar panels do a great job of collecting energy from sunlight, but that does little for homeowners on cloudy or rainy days. While Southern California is known for its sunshine and relatively low amount of precipitation can’t hide the fact that there are more than 100 days with at least some cloud cover. To get by with renewable energy during those times, electricity storage an make a significant difference.

Unfortunately, there had been relatively little development in battery technology until the advent of Tesla and its electrical vehicles. However, the company’s Powerwall technology includes not just on-demand storage but intelligent controls of cycling, backup and monitoring for homeowners. Tesla certifies installers to ensure that they operate within the performance statistics

# How to Pay for Photovoltaic Systems
There are a number of ways to pay for the cost to install solar panels in San Diego, and it may be helpful to think about them similarly to a new or used car, truck or SUV. Homeowners can buy or finance systems outright, or lease them. Which makes sense depends heavily on your credit history, tax burden and several other factors.

However, there is a key difference in the case of power purchase agreements. Also known as PPA, this agreement is between a company and a homeowner but is in addition to the relationship with the local electrical utility. More specifically, a solar panel lease agreement is in place for 20 to 25 years but the homeowner still uses whatever electricity is generated and then pays their utility provider for the remainder that they need.

In the case of a PPA, the homeowner does not own or lease the solar system. They agree to pay a set amount for the electricity generated by the solar panels on their home that they use. While the company providing the system in a PPA shoulders the liability if the system breaks down, it also gains any tax incentives.

# Find Out How Much It Costs to Install Solar Panels in Your San Diego Home
The true cost to install solar panels in San Diego varies based on your needs, existing home and roof and budget. Work with experienced contractors who can provide a variety of solutions so that you are not tied down to options that are not a good fit for all situations.
